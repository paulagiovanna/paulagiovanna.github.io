          The problem consists in classify Amazonia satellite imagery in labels of weather conditions and land use patterns. It was taken from kaggle which, in partnership with Plannet, made available more than 40,000 classified images and more than 60,000 images to a blind test. The images were divided in chips, i.e instead of use an image with 6600×2200 pixels - representing 19877.88 hectares - we are using chips with 256×256 pixels - representing 89.7187 hectares. Each chip should be classified on one of 4 labels about weatherconditions and none or more of 13 labels about land use patterns. Figure 1 shows some examples of this classifications. The chips can be classified with none labels about land use patterns if the weather conditions cover the camera, as in case of 1st chip in Figure 1, the weather condition is "cloudy" and it doesn't allow us to se the land use patterns. The possible classifications are: <br>
          weather conditions: clear - when the sky is without any pertubation; cloudy; partly cloudy and haze <br>
          Land use Patterns: primary - when the image shows primary forest; agriculture; cultivation - which is like a familiar agriculture; road; water; habitation; bare ground; selective logging; artisinal mine; blooming; slash and burn; blow down and conventional mine.

            The 17 labels aren't well distributed, Figure 2 shows the discrepancy among labels quantity. While 'primary' has appered in almost every image in our image set, labels such as 'artisinal mine', 'blooming', 'slash and burn', 'blow down' and 'conventional mine' when added together don't even represent 5% of image labels, because of this from now on I will call them 'interest classes'.

            Due to the low number of our interest classes a search for something that could compensate it became necessary. Figure 3 shows the correlation between labels, i.e the percentile of images labeled on X class that also have the label Y. As we can see, the graph isn't mirrored, i.e a big number of appearance of a class with another  doesn't make the opposite true. We can see some obvious correlations like 'primary' with almost every other classes - once 'primary' appears in almost all images that is a thing that we could predict -  but we also can se some interesting correlations, like the high percentile of correlation between 'artisinal mine' and 'water', 'conventional mine' and 'road' and 'slash and burn' with 'agriculture' and 'cultivation'. This correlations are interesting because they can help us to compensate the lack of examples that we have to give to the deep learning networks.

            In order to explore more the relationships that could be helpful for the finding of our interests classes by the deeplearning networks, the graph in Figure 4 was created. Each node represents a label - excluding weather condition labels - and each edge represents how many times two labels appeared together - strong edges means that two labels appears together in a large set of images, whereas weak edges represents that two labels almost never appeared together. As we can se, our interest classes have less strong edges than the other classes. From that we could think that a set of other labels, that our interest class have a strong edge, can define if it will appear at the image.

            The Figure 5 presents the analysis about if a set of strong edges could define if a interest class will or not appear in some image. As we can see despite of exists, this definition is still weak. The class with greater possibility of being described by another ones was 'artisinal mine' and it's biggest possibility of description was 28.13% what isn't neither the a half of number of appearness of this class on the image set.
