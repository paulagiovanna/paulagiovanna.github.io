          The problem consists in classify Amazonia satellite imagery in labels of weather conditions and land use patterns. It was taken from kaggle which, in partnership with Plannet, made available more than 40,000 classified images and more than 60,000 images to a blind test. The images were divided in chips, i.e instead of use an image with 6600×2200 pixels - representing 19877.88 hectares - we are using chips with 256×256 pixels - representing 89.7187 hectares. Each chip should be classified on one of 4 labels about weatherconditions and none or more of 13 labels about land use patterns. Figure 1 shows some examples of this classifications. The chips can be classified with none labels about land use patterns if the weather conditions cover the camera, as in case of 1st chip in Figure 1, the weather condition is "cloudy" and it doesn't allow us to se the land use patterns. The possible classifications are: <br>
          weather conditions: clear - when the sky is without any pertubation; cloudy; partly cloudy and haze <br>
          Land use Patterns: primary - when the image shows primary forest; agriculture; cultivation - which is like a familiar agriculture; road; water; habitation; bare ground; selective logging; artisinal mine; blooming; slash and burn; blow down and conventional mine.

            The 17 labels aren't well distributed, Figure 2 shows the discrepancy among labels quantity. While 'primary' has appered in almost every image in our image set, labels such as 'artisinal mine', 'blooming', 'slash and burn', 'blow down' and 'conventional mine' when added together don't even represent 5% of image labels.

            Due to the low number of some labels a search for something that could compensate it became necessary. Figure 3 shows the correlation between labels, i.e the percentile of images labeled on X class that also have the label Y. As we can see, the graph isn't mirrored, i.e a big number of appearance of a class with another  doesn't make the opposite true. We can see some obvious correlations like 'primary' with almost every other classes - once 'primary' appears in almost all images that is a thing that we could predict -  but we also can se some interesting correlations, like the high percentile of correlation between 'artisinal mine' and 'water', 'conventional mine' and 'road' and 'slash and burn' with 'agriculture' and 'cultivation'. This correlations are interesting because they can help us to compensate the lack of examples that we have to give to the deep learning networks.

            In order to explore more the relationships that could be helpful for deeplearning networks, the graph in Figure 4 was created. Each node represents a label - excluding weather condition labels - and each edge represents one time that two labels appeared together - bold edges means that two labels appears together in a large set of images whereas if two nodes don't have an edge, so their labels never appeared together.
